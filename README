# TDD Kata

These are my attempts to work through Roy Osherove's StringCalculator TDD Kata exercise:

## Exercise

(pulled from Roy's blog post for easy reference)

Try not to read ahead. do one task at a time. the trick is to learn to work incrementally.

### String Calculator

1. Create a simple String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers)
  * The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty 
    string it will return 0) for example "" or "1" or "1,2"
  * Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbers
  * Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write
    tests you did not think about
  * Remember to refactor after each passing test

2. Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers

3. Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
  * the following input is ok: "1\n2,3"  (will equal 6)
  * the following input is NOT ok: "1,\n"
  * Make sure you only test for correct inputs. there is no need to test for invalid
    inputs for these katas
     
4. Allow the Add method to handle a different delimiter:
  * To change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that
    looks like this: "//[delimiter]\n[numbers]" for example "//;\n1;2" should return
    three where the default delimiter is ';' .
  * The first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported

5. Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception "negatives not allowed" -
   and the negative that was passed.if there are multiple negatives, show all of them in
   the exception message
  
Stop here if you are a beginner. Continue if you can finish the steps so far in less
than 30 minutes.
 
1. Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001  = 2
2. Delimiters can be of any length with the following format:  "//[delimiter]\n" for
   example: "//***\n1***2***3" should return 6
3. Allow multiple delimiters like this:  "//[delim1][delim2]\n" for example
   "//[\*][%]\n1*2%3" should return 6.
4. make sure you can also handle multiple delimiters with length longer than one char
